markdown# Video Editor Prompt

Turn messy raw footage into a tight, polished script. This prompt helps you identify which takes to keep, what to cut, and how to structure your final edit.

## Quick Start

1. **Get your video ready** (see options below)
2. **Copy the prompt** at the bottom of this file
3. **Paste into your AI of choice** with your video/transcript
4. **Review the edit recommendations**

## Recommended Models

| Model | Video Support | How to Use |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** ⭐ | ✅ Direct upload or YouTube link | Upload video or paste link directly |
| **ChatGPT (GPT-4o)** | ✅ Upload only | Upload video file in chat |
| **Claude** | ❌ No video | Transcribe first, then paste transcript |

**Best option:** Gemini — just paste a YouTube link or upload your raw footage directly.

## Three Ways to Use This

### Option 1: Direct Video (Gemini or ChatGPT)
1. Upload your raw video file or paste the YouTube link
2. Paste the prompt below
3. Get edit recommendations with timestamps

### Option 2: Transcript First (Any Model)
1. Transcribe your video using:
   - YouTube auto-captions (free)
   - Descript (free tier available)
   - Whisper (free, local)
   - TurboScribe (fast, cheap)
2. Paste transcript + prompt into any AI
3. Get edit recommendations

### Option 3: Manual Timestamps
If you need precise cuts, include timestamps in your transcript:
```
[0:00] I used to write five different posts...
[0:05] I used to write five different... (trails off)
[0:08] I used to write five different posts for every piece of content.
[0:12] Now I write one idea and this workflow handles the rest.
```

## The Prompt
```
You are a video editor analyzing raw footage to create a polished script.

YOUR GOALS (in priority order):
1. FLOW - Must sound natural when spoken aloud
2. VALUE - Every sentence earns its place  
3. DURATION - 45-60 seconds for shorts, tighter is better

WHAT RAW FOOTAGE LOOKS LIKE:
When someone records, they often:
- Try the same line 3-4 times (duplicate takes)
- Stumble and restart mid-sentence (failed takes)
- Warm up as they go (later takes are usually BETTER)

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
For each segment, ask:

1. Is this a duplicate of something already kept?
   → Keep only ONE (prefer the LAST complete take)

2. Is it incomplete, stuttering, or garbled?
   → Cut it

3. Does it add NEW information?
   → Keep it

4. Does it flow naturally from the previous line?
   → If not, you may need to keep a transition

WHAT TO CUT AGGRESSIVELY:
- Filler phrases: "basically," "you know," "honestly," "like"
- Self-references: "as I mentioned," "like I said"
- Redundancy: same point stated twice in different words
- Technical fluff: model names, specs viewers don't care about

STRUCTURE TO PRESERVE:
- HOOK: Problem → Solution → Credibility (first 10-15 sec)
- BODY: Steps or explanation (the value)
- CTA: What viewer should do next

OUTPUT FORMAT:
List segments to KEEP in playback order:
- Timestamp range
- What it covers
- Why it was kept

Then list what was CUT and why.

REMEMBER: A tight 45-second video beats a bloated 90-second one. When in doubt, cut it.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Record more takes than you need** — the AI will find the best one
2. **Say your hook 3-4 times** — you'll warm up and the last take is usually cleanest
3. **Don't worry about mistakes while recording** — that's what this is for
4. **Review the AI's recommendations** — it's a starting point, not gospel

## Example Output
```
KEEP:
[0:08-0:12] "I used to write five different posts for every piece of content."
  → Hook problem statement, last complete take

[0:12-0:16] "Now I write one idea and this workflow handles the rest."
  → Hook solution, clean delivery

[0:16-0:19] "I haven't manually repurposed anything in weeks."
  → Credibility statement

CUT:
[0:00-0:05] First take of hook - incomplete, speaker warming up
[0:05-0:08] Second take - trails off mid-sentence
```
